Task:

In your group assign who does which tasks. each person will need to do their own branch, merge, committing to the group repository. The points are the difficulty to the tasks (called stories in Scrum). Higher points == harder. Each person must do roughly the same amount of points as another.

 

General Idea behind this project:

With out own assembly code we want the user to be able to run the code. All the assembly codes are attached in a separate file in this assignment. Please download it.

The code will be able to retrieve user input (rich textbox, list box, etc. However you decide to do this), run commands, and output results.

User input must be editable. Output must not be editable

Registers are your immediate locations in 'memory' that you can access.

 

Tasks:

1 points:
GUI Design (paper)
GUI Design (visual studio)
Creating Global variables for 3 Registers
Display all 3 registers
Change the values displayed if the value within the registers have changed.
2 points: 
Saving the Commands into a List in the order they were read.
Creating the object that holds all the user commands from the user input.
3 points:
Retrieving user input and separating it into an object that contains the following structures:

Command, Var1, Var2, Var3
Command, Var1, Var2
Command, Var1
Get the LD (for numbers only, not variables), ADD , SUB, MUL, DIV, and TRP to work. For all the mathematical operations focus only on getting the command R# R# R# to work.
 

This is not completed. It is still in progress. You'll be notified when it is done.
